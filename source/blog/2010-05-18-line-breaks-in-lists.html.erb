  content: ! "Pam thanks for reply \r\n\r\nActually I am not good at PHP coding, I
    have tried the explode function, and I have echoed explode function where I have
    to show the country address from the title. \r\n\r\nBut the jobs titles differs
    as there are many jobs on the site. How can I automatically get the only address/location
    extract from job title using explode and display it in location column, this should
    work for all the jobs on the site.\r\n\r\nthere is column for job title, job location
    and job date.\r\n\r\njob title refer this - \"VP Venture Banker – New York, New
    York, United States\"\r\n\r\nerror getting on site after using explode. \r\n\r\nArray
    ( [0] =&gt; VP Venture Banker � New York, New York, United States ) Array\r\n\r\ncan
    you give me full php function for this and how to call that on the location.\r\n\r\nplease
    help here....\r\n\r\nthanks again"

  content: ! "It looks like function is not finding the character you are telling
    it to split by. Try again with a space and see what it looks like--you should
    see something like Array([0]=>VP [1]=>Venture .....etc. It's probably actually
    a unicode emdash. If strpos(yourstring, \"-\") gives you false instead of a number
    you are looking for the wrong character.\r\n\r\nIt sounds a lot like you're trying
    to create a site that screen scrapes a lot of other sites. I'd like to advise
    against that. Sites tend to get cranky about that, and for good reason. You are
    stealing the content that they have put time and money into accumulating (even
    if other people contribute it, they had to build the site and build up the brand
    to attract those users in the first place), and you are stealing their bandwidth
    without giving anything back by routinely crawling their site. If you go this
    route, make sure you have something unique to offer besides just repackaging content
    form other sites, and make sure you have a backup plan for when they send you
    a cease and desist letter."

    I was not able to break the unicode character and was finding it difficult to
    break. \r\n\r\nI have tried the unicode character but its not recognizing the
    \"-\" character. I think I need to make it manual task.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    I have not tried to do anything with comments on author pages before, and I don''t
    have time to write your code for you, I''m sorry. You will probably have better
    luck in the Wordpress forums. You might also look into Buddy Press and its extensions,
    they may already have the feature you need.'

<p>Periodically I encounter some problem with html and css layouts that could be solved by adding a few extra presentational tags to the html source (like &lt;br/&gt; or text bullets in the case I'm about to describe), but there's no easy way to do it in CSS.  I almost always end up caving and doing it that way, but I like <a href="<%= post_url('HTML5, CSS3, and the Great CSS-Off') %>">flailing around and trying new things</a> first before giving up.  I feel like sharing the most recent example because I'm almost proud of it, and in some circumstances it might actually be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>What I have is a list of links for a blog.  This is an excellent candidate for an unordered list, except that I want them presented like so:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">one - two - three</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">four - five - six</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">seven - eight</p>
<p>The trick here is getting the dashes so they show up <strong>only in the middle of each line</strong>.  But there's no easy way to tell where the natural line breaks are, so I cant just have the first &lt;li&gt; per line not have a dash in front of it.  That means I'm probably going to need to insert some line breaks so I know which ones are at the beginning of a line, but I'd still rather not do it in the html.</p>
<p>I ended up with this:</p>

<% code("css") do %>
.blogroll { text-align: center; }
.blogroll li { display: inline; padding: 0 6px; }
.blogroll li + li:before { content: '-'; position: relative; left: -8px; }
.blogroll li:nth-child(3n+1):before { content: '\a'; position: static; white-space: pre; }
<% end %>

<p>The first two lines just make the elements centered, inline, and separated a bit.  The third line puts a dash before all&lt;li&gt; elements that come after another &lt;li&gt; element--effectively everything but the very first in the list.  The fourth one is the magic: it uses a new css selector <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoclass-nthchild">nth-child</a> to select <strong>the element after every third element</strong> (that's the "3n+1" bit) and <strong>replaces the dash with a newline</strong> character (that's the "\a" bit).  Normally newline characters are just converted to spaces, but setting the white-space to "pre" makes the line actually wrap there.</p>
<p>It almost works!  Unfortunately, there is a case it doesn't handle well.  If one of the items is too long, the lines will wrap before the third item and you end up with this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">one - two  - three</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">four - reallyreallylong</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">- six</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">seven -  eight</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh well.  I guess I'll be putting those line breaks in by hand after all.  But if you don't have to worry about that, it might actually be a good technique!</p>
